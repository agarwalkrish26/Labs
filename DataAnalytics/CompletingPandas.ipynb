    "2. There were 126 married women on the boat out of which 100 survived the crash and 26 died.  \n",
    "3. There are total 310 females (with categorized Titles) out of which 54 died and had atleast 1 family member and the other 27 who died had no family.  \n",
    "4. There are total 40 men under the age of 18 out of which 23 survived the crash and the other 17 died during the crash.  \n",
    "5. There are total 514 men above the age of 18 out of which 81 survived the crash and the other 432 died during the crash.  \n",
    "6. There are total 554 men (with categorizable Titles) out of which 117 died and had atleast one family member and the other 332 who died had no family.  \n",
    "7. When the average survival rate of total men and women were compared, then it was seen that women had more survival ratio than men.  \n",
    "8. The dataset was divided on the basis of their Pclass values; 1 signifying lower class, 2 signifying middle class and 3 signifying rich class. Rich class bought tickets roughly worth upto Rs. 6822.12 while middle class bought tickets roughly worth Rs. 1691.39 and the lower class bought tickets roughly worth Rs. 1094.50.  \n",
    "9. When the total was disrtibuted and plotted between all the classes of passengers, it was noticed that Rich class contributed the most (63.4%), followed by the lower class (23.3%) and then the middle class (13.3%).  \n",
    "10. 15 people hadn't paid any fare for their tickets and they seem to have no family as well. This may conclude they were either orphans or loners and the people who did pass on their tickets probably had done this out of empathy.  \n",
    "11. When the total fare was distributed amongst the males and females, it was noticed that men contributed the majority by a small margin.  \n",
    "12. It was noticed that 16 entries didn't had general titles. Out of these 16, 15 are males and 1 is a female. None of them belong to the lower cost. Amongst them, only 4 survived (1 Colonel and 3 Doctors).  \n",
    "13. It was noticed that there exists 7 wrong entries with age 0 and which is not possible."
